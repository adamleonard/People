People is a White Pages application for iPhone and iPod Touch that allows you to quickly and easily find a full name, address, and phone number for almost anyone. 

¥ Search over 180 million public listings (80% of US adults) using just the information you know- a name, partial address, or phone number.

¥ See a list of search results. Then, with one tap, call the person, view the address in the Maps application, or add the person to your contacts.

¥ Find people near your current location automatically. Perfect if you are looking for someone's house, but forget their exact address.
